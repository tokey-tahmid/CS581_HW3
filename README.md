# First, ssh login to one of the EECS lab machines.
# Then, either git clone the repository or download and move the zip folder to your directory and unzip
# cd to unzipped folder/ clonned folder
# Then, considering python is already installed, just run the command "python HW3.py" (otherwise install python first)
# You should get the output "2 5 8 9 11 12 23 34 45 52"
